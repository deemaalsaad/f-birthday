                            Some people just make everything better by being there â€” and youâ€™re definitely one of them.
                             I honestly love every moment with you.
                            Youâ€™re my favorite clown (in the best way Ø·Ø¨Ø¹Ø§Ù‹ðŸ˜œ) and the best duo I could ever ask for on PS.
                            Thanks for being you. Letâ€™s make this year full of memories as real and fun as you are

                                                    Happy BirthdayÂ Fahad!!ðŸ’“
